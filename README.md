## Repository Structure

Only top-level figure directories are described below. Some of these contains its own `README` file.

### **`Figure_1/`**
Contains scripts and data supporting quantification of live/dead imaging data.

### **`Figure_2/`**
Contains MATLAB and Python scripts for quantitative calcium imaging analysis, including fluorescence extraction, spike detection, and spectral characterization of neuronal activity.

### **`Figure_3/`**
Includes all workflows for bulk RNA-seq data preprocessing, differential expression, GSEA/ORA, HOMER motif analysis, and supporting datasets for both mouse and human compressed neuron models.

### **`Figure_4/`**
Includes all workflows for bulk RNA-seq data preprocessing, differential expression, GSEA/ORA for comressed human astrocytes. Also contains analyses of immunocytochemistry (ICC), morphology quantification, qPCR datasets supporting molecular and phenotypic responses to compression.

### **`Figure_5/`**
Includes preprocessing, QC, Seurat workflows, multi-dataset integration, BayesPrism outputs, and all scripts used to analyze and visualize single-cell and spatially informed human GBM datasets relevant to mechanical stress signatures.

### **Other files**
- **`Patzke-Datta.Rproj`** — RStudio project file.
